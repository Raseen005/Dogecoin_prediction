The DogCoin Prediction Project aims to predict the future prices of DogCoin using machine learning techniques. We utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and making predictions, with a focus on ensuring that the predictions are interpretable in the original scale of the data.
